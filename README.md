## Description

During this week, I was tasked to develop a web application's API for a social network, enabling users to share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and create a list of friends. The API will be built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database for storage, and the Mongoose ODM for data modeling. Optionally, you can utilize a JavaScript date library of your preference or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
